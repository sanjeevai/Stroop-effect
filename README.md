# Stroop Effect

## Introduction

This is the first project in Term 2 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. It was created to test the basic understanding of hypothesis testing.

## Background Information

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the _color_ of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the _congruent_ words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the _incongruent_ words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
